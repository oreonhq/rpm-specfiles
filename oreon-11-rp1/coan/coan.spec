%description
%{name} (formerly sunifdef) is a software engineering tool for analyzing
pre-processor-based configurations of C or C++ source code. Its principal use
is to simplify a body of source code by eliminating any parts that are
redundant with respect to a specified configuration.

%{name} is most useful to developers of constantly evolving products
with large code bases, where pre-processor conditionals are used to
configure the feature sets, APIs or implementations of different
releases. In these environments the code base steadily
accumulates #ifdef-pollution as transient configuration options become
obsolete. %{name} can largely automate the recurrent task of purging
redundant #if-logic from the code.

%prep
test "%{source0_hash}" = "none" || { f="%{SOURCE0}"; test -f "$f" || { echo "oreon: missing Source0 $f" >&2; exit 1; }; h=$(sha256sum "$f" | awk '{print $1}'); test "$h" = "%{source0_hash}" || { echo "oreon: Source0 hash mismatch" >&2; exit 1; }; }
