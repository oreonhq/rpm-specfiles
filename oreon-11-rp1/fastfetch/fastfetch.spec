# The shell completion files were previously provided as separate subpackages

%description
fastfetch is a neofetch-like tool for fetching system information and
displaying them in a pretty way. It is written in c to achieve much better
performance, in return only Linux and Android are supported. It also uses
mechanisms like multithreading and caching to finish as fast as possible.
