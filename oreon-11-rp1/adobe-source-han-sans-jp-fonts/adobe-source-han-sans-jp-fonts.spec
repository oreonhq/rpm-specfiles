# Packaging template: basic single-family fonts packaging.
#
# SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
#
# This template documents the minimal set of spec declarations, necessary to
# package a single font family, from a single dedicated source archive.
#
# It is part of the following set of packaging templates:
# “fonts-0-simple”: basic single-family fonts packaging
# “fonts-1-full”:   less common patterns for single-family fonts packaging
# “fonts-2-multi”:  multi-family fonts packaging
# “fonts-3-sub”:    packaging fonts, released as part of something else
#
# A font family is composed of font files, that share a single design, and
# differ ONLY in:
# — Weight        Bold, Black…
# – Width∕Stretch Narrow, Condensed, Expanded…
# — Slope/Slant   Italic, Oblique
# Optical sizing  Caption…
#
# Those parameters correspond to the default axes of OpenType variable fonts:
# https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/dvaraxisreg#registered-axis-tags
# The variable fonts model is an extension of the WWS model described in the
# WPF Font Selection Model whitepaper (2007):

#
# Do not rely on the naming upstream chose, to define family boundaries, it
# will often be wrong.
#
# Declaration order is chosen to limit divergence between those templates, and
# simplify cut and pasting.
