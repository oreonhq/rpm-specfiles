# Quick start

Please look at the following files for a quick start with the various database
backends:

- `quickstart_mysql.txt`
- `quickstart_postgresql.txt`
- `quickstart_sqlite3.txt`

# PostgreSQL, MySQL and SQLite databases

Bacula director supports different databases backends, if you want to switch
away from the default PostgreSQL one you need to change the `libbaccats` (the
catalogue library) symlink to the real library.

To change to a different backend, issue the following command:
```
# alternatives --config libbaccats.so
```

There are 3 libraries which provide `libbaccats.so`.
```
  Selection    Command
-----------------------------------------------
   1           /usr/lib64/libbaccats-mysql.so
   2           /usr/lib64/libbaccats-sqlite3.so
*+ 3           /usr/lib64/libbaccats-postgresql.so
```
Enter to keep the current selection`[+]`, or type selection number: `1`

There is NO need to edit any part in the Bacula Director configuration; for the
purposes of the database creation steps, the `bacula-dir.conf` configuration file
can be left at their default values.

## Switiching between PostgreSQL, MySQL and SQLite backends

To switch the configured backend to another one, follow the above procedure.
Again, there's no need to edit the Bacula Director configuration file; the
catalog resource can be left as is.

Importing and exporting data between the various database formats is up to the
user. If the database will be re-initialized from scratch, follow the quick
start guides mentioned above.

# Upgrading from old Redhat releases

When upgrading from old Redhat releases, the `bacula-libs-sql` package takes
care of making the appropriate selection for the database backend based on what
was previously configured on the old system.

The default permissions in the `/etc/bacula` folder have changed; please perform
the following commands for restoring the permissions for the correct operation
of the daemons.
```
# chown -R root:root /etc/bacula
# chmod 755 /etc/bacula
# chmod 640 /etc/bacula/*
# chgrp bacula /etc/bacula/bacula-dir.conf /etc/bacula/query.sql
```
All the files that are part of the Director configuration (included with @) must
of course have the same permissions as the main configuration file.

# Documentation

To see all the available documentation in both HTML and PDF formats. see here:

# Granting user access to the console

The console configuration files are normally readable only by root for security
reasons. If you need to grant access to a specific user or group of users to
the consoles, you can adjust the ACLs on the configuration files. For example:
```
# setfacl -m u:user:r /etc/bacula/bconsole.conf /etc/bacula/bat.conf
```
This way the user 'user' can open the console without superuser privileges.
